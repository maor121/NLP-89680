Dear future self,

The following exercise possibly has two bugs:

1) PMI: window + pmi gives weird results. Less so then none PMIs. Need to investigate this if you have the time
(which you probably don't)

2) Treebank similarity: not even one IN word passes into the filtered contexts of the target words. Need to investigate.
