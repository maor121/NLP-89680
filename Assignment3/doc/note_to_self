Dear future self,

The following exercise possibly has two bugs:

1) PMI: window + pmi gives weird results. Less so then none PMIs. Need to investigate this if you have the time
(which you probably don't)

2) Weighted jaccard matrix does not seem to give good results. It's good it is not part of the assignment
