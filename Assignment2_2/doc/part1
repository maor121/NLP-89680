1. Why the grammar generate so many long sentences? Which rule is responsible?

The rule [1	NP	NP PP] is responsible because it has two recursion points. It opens NP to NP again, and PP is opened
later to Prep NP, so NP is opened again. Removing this rule give very short sentences.

2. The grammar allow multiple Adj, why does this happen so rarely?

Because we have only one nonterminal rules (Noun -> Adj Noun), but 5 terminal rules (Noun -> word)
So only 1 in 6 Nouns will have Adj before it, and 1 in 36 will have Adj Adj Noun

3. Which numbers must you modify to fix the problems in (a) and (b),
making the sentences shorter and the adjectives more frequent?

I changed the following weights:
0.4	NP	NP PP           # Making sentences shorter
4	Noun	Adj Noun    # Making Adj Adj 4 times more frequent (4 in 36, or 2 in 18)

The "magical numbers" (weights) were chosen by trial and error until I saw that the sentences generated look reasonable.
