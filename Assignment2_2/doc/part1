1. Why the grammar generate so many long sentences? Which rule is responsible?

The rule [1	NP	NP PP] is responsible because it has two recursion points. It opens NP to NP again, and PP is opened
later to Prep NP, so NP is opened again. Removing this rule give very short sentences.

2. The grammar allow multiple Adj, why does this happen so rarely?

Because we have only one nonterminal rules (Noun -> Adj Noun), but 5 terminal rules (Noun -> word)
